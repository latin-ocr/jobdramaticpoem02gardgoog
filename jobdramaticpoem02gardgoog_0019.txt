Deus intelligit viam eiuS, et ipse novit locum
illius. Et dixit homini: Ecce timor Domini,
ipsa est sapientia, et recedere a malo, intelli-
gentia. ·

IOB.

Scio, quia omnes potes, et nulla te latet cogi-
tatio. Auditu auris audivi te, nunc autem
oculus meus videt te. Idcirco ipse me repre-
hendo, et ago poenitentiam in favilla et cinere.

MULIER.

Diligam te, Domine, fortitudo mea. Laudans
invocabo Dominum, et ab inimicis meis salvus
ero.

AMICUS.

Dolores inferni circumdederunt me: praeoc-
cupaverunt me laquei *mortis

IOB.

In tribulatione mea invocavi Dominum, etad
Deum meum clamavi. Et exaudivit de templo
sancto suo vocem meam, et clamor mens in
conspectu eius introivit in aures eius.

Commota est, et contremuit terra: lunda·
menta montium conturbata sunt, et commota

THE WOMAN.

God only understandeth what is the way
thereos, he only knoweth where is the place
thereos. And he saith unto man: Lo, all wis-
dom, this it is, that thou shouldst live in fear
ol him, and to cast away all evil, is understand·
ing.

Jon.

I know thou canst do all things, and nothing
can be withholden from thy sight. With mine
own hearing I heard of thee, but now the eye oi
my sight beholdeth thee. And therefore mine
own lips do condemn me and I am low in peni·
tence; dust and ashes cover me.

THE WOMAN.

I will love the Lord my God, my strength
and my redeemer. I will call upon him, prais-
ing him and from mine enemies I shall find
salvation.

THE FRIEND.

The sorrows ol darkness lolded me round
about: the snares and deceits 01 death lastened
upon me.

Jon.

ln anguish and in tribulation I have called
upon the Lord, unto God Almighty I cried out.
And he gave ear from his holy temple, to my
voice he hearkened; my lamentation came
before his presence and he opened his ears to
hear me.

JOB, aare WOMAN, arvo ma FRIEND.

The earth then shook and the lrame 01 11
trembled. On their deep foundations the hills
and the mountains swayed, and they shook
with sear for the Lord was angered against
them.

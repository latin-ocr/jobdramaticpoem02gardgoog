ADrumutio Poem for Soli, Obortis aad Orabam by F. S. Conversa·
(op. 24)

THE text of the poem consists of passages from the boolr of Job and the Psalms, grouped to
form a short poetical unit. In the Bible story the cosmic background for Job’s experiences
is the agreement between Jehovah and Satan to try the man's faith. In the present poem the
universal order, in the midst of which Job plays his part 0f human suffering, rebellion, 3ηά final
submissim, is represented by passages from the Psalms which express the permanence 3ηά glory
of God and his creation. The passages which comprise the text are chosen for the mood they
convey without regard to their exact place in the Bible. In the main they follow the course of the
Bible story and suggest the “ argument'' of the original, but the words of the Bible are sometimes
put in the mouth of a different person, and in some of the musical units the words are assembled
from several parts of the Bible text.

The dramatic motive of the poem is the development of the moods of Job, distress under
suffering, rebellion, doubt, 3ηά final submissive understanding of the will of God. In emotional
contrast with him isthe Woman of Israel, who represents the spirit of unquestioning faith. The
Friend stands like the three friends of the Bible story, for the spirit of conventional piety. Τὴο
chorus represents superhuman voices which declare the glory of God3 against their sustained
mood of adoration and praise beats the contest of human emotions. The impersonal universal
spirit of the chorus is conveyed in the music by simple diatonic harmonies, the warp upon which
the solo parts are woven in modern chromatio design.

The poem opens with an orchestral preinde, which is followed with the antiphone: ⁴‘ Mis·
erere mihi,” sung by the Woman of Israel. A small chorus, unaccompanied, takes up the prayer.
This isanswered by the full chorus in the Psalm: ‘⁴ Laudate Dominum.’' Across this flood of
adoration rises Job's lament, in which he curses the day he was born 3ηά longs for death. The
F riend describes in a dramatic scene a vision in which a spirit has appeared to him at night and
a voice has asked how man can compare himself to God and fathom the mysteries of the infinite.
The wisdom of God is unsearchable, 3ηά the pure and faithful shall be blessed. The Woman
and the chorus of female voices sing: “How excellent is thy name in all the earth 1. . . ..What is
man that Thou art mindful of him? ’' ·

Job tells his friend that he will expostulate with God and show that hedeserves not his
afflictions. The Friend “ reproveth Job of impiety in justifying himself.'' The Woman joins the
reproof and this leads to a dramatic climax in which the full chorus proclaims the destruction of
the wicked. But Job, unreconciled, shows that the wicked do prosper and “bemoaneth himself
of his former prosperity and honor.'' In ecstatic revery he recalls the happiness of departed
days Toward the end of his revery the Woman 3ηά the Friend sing of the “sundry blessings
which follow them that fear God,'’ and the full chorus takes up the theme.

Job protests that he is not a sinful man. ln defiance of his friend, and proudly confident
of his righteousness‚ he appeals to God to judge him.

Then “out of the whirlwind,” which is described in an orchestral episode, comes the voice
of Jehovah in answer to Job’s appeal. With overwhelming irony-“ Where wast thou when I laid
the foundation of the earth? '’-the voice “convincem’' Job of the ignorance 3ηά pettiness of
human life 3ηά utters the grandeur 3ηά permanence of creation.

Job, humbled and overcome, asks, “Whence then cometh wisdom?'’ and the woman
answerS, “Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.’' Job ‘¹ submitteth himself unto God,'’
and rises strong in his new wisdom. The Woman sings‚ “I will love thee, Ο Lord, my strength.”

The Friend 3ηά Job take up'the theme. T he chorus chants: “Bless the Lord, Ο my soul.’'
The phrase, “Thou hast laid the foundations of the earth” echoes the voice of Jehovah ,
in the earlier episode. Thus from Job’s experience the etemity and maJesty of nature is the theme r

wlhich emerges and dominatos. The poem ends with the triumphant ‘¹ Laudate ’' oi the opening
c orus.

eius super caput meum, et ad lumen eius am-

bulabam in tenebris? Sicut fui in diebus
adolescentia meae, quando erat Omnipotens
mecum, et in circuitu meo pueri mei. Iustitia
indutus sum: et vestivi me, sicut vestimento et
diademate, iudicio meo. Dicebamque: In ni·
dulo meo moriar, et sicut palma multiplicabo

dies.

MULIER.

Beati omnes, qui timent Dominum, qui arn-
bulant in viis eius.
IOB.

Radix mea aperta est secus aquas, et ros
morabitur in messione mea.

AMlCUS.

' Labores manuum tuarum quia manducabis.

CHORUS.

Beatus eS, et bene tibi erit. Uxor tua, sicut
vitis abundans, in lateribus domus tuae. Ecce,
sic benedicetur home, qui timet Dominum.

IOB.

Quis mihi tribuat auditorem, ut desiderium
meum audiat Omnipotens Per singulos gradus
meos pronuntiabo illum, et quasi principii
offeram eum.

the old days, the months departed, when the i

Lord held me in his mighty hand, days when ¹
the flame ol his splendor spread its brightness ’

311 about me, and beneath his light I wallred in ἦ

salety through the darkness? Even so my
way was lighted through all the days ol my

ripencss‚ when the Lord in his mercy was with ¹

me and in a circle my children gathered about
me. In righteousness I wrapped mysell‚ I had
clothed me with the robe of justice, it wasa
diadem, a garment about me. Then I said: I
shall die in the nest that shelters me, and like
the palm tree number my days full many.

THE WOMAN:

Blessed, thrice blessed, are they richo fear the
Lord, who follow in his ways forever.

THE FRIEND.

For what thine hands produce by labor thou
shalt consume it.

CHORUS.

And blessed be, thou shalt be called happy.
For beside thee as a vine that is laden, shall the

wile of thine house be fruitlul. Lo, how that ἶ
man shall be blessed who walketh in the lear ol ’

God.

Jon.

Oh, would that there were one who should
hear me, oh, my desire is great that thou shouldst
hear my prayer, Almighty God. And I will
declare my reasons, yea, one by one pronounce
them, and as to a prince will I come before thee.

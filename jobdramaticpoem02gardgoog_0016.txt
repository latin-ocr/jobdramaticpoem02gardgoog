mentium. Condemnabit te os tuum, et non
ego: et labia tua respondebunt tibi.

AMICUS.

Nonne lux impii extinguetur, nec splendebit
flamma ignis eius?

MULIER.

Lux obtenebrescet in tabernaculo illiue, et
lucerna, quae super eum est, extinguetur.

MULIER Er AMICUS.

Revelabunt coeli iniquitatem eius, et terra
consurget adversus eum. Apertum erit germen
illius, detrahetur in die furoris Dei. Haec est
pars hominis impii a Deo, et hereditas verbo·
rum eius a Domino.

JOB

evil and thou dost imitate the tongue of blas-
phemy. Itis thine own mouth and not mine
that condemneth thee, yea thine own lips shall
testiiy against thee.

THE FRIEND.

For the light oi the wiclred shall perish and
the spark oi his dame shall die in darkness

THE WOMAN.

Light shall be extinguishedwithin his dwelling-
place evermore, and the candle which hangs
above his head shall not light him. ¹

THE WOMAN AND ran FRIEND.

Heaven shall lay him bare, his iniquity un-
cover, and earth shall reveal him and rise
against him. The increase of his house shall
flow away from him: in the day of God’s anger
it shall be taken. This is the heritage which
the Lord appointeth unto wickedness, the por-

. tion granted to wicked men.

CHORUS.

Quoniam, qui malignantur, exterminabuntur,
sustinentes autem Dominum: ipsi hereditabunt
terram, et delectabuntur in multitudine pacis,
Quia peccatores peribunt. Inimici vero Domini
mox ut honorificati luerint et exaltati, deficien-
teS, quemadmodum fumus deficient.

IOB.

Attendite me, et obstupescite, et superponite
digitum ori vestro: et eg0, quando recordatus
fuero, pertimesco, et concutit carnem meam
tremor. Quare ergo impii vivunt, sublevati
sunt, confirmatique divitiis? Domus eorum
securae sunt et pacatae, et non est virga Dei
super illos. Quis mihi tribuat, ut sim iuxta
menses pristinos secundum dies, quibus Deus
custodiebat me, quando splendebat lucerna

Woe to them, all evil doers: they shall be
accursed; but the faithful, they that walt on
God, they shall inherit the earth, in the ways of
peace they shall find abundant sweetness. But
all evildoers shall perish. He shall east out all
his enemies; they shall vanish at the moment
when they have beenraised to honor and proudly

away.

Joa.

Now hearken to me and be astonished, and
let your finger-tips lie on your mouth for wonder,
and m'ark me, when I do bethink me how it is,
I am feariul, my body is shaken with trembling.
Whereiore do the impious flourish, why are
they upheld, how do they come to prosperity?

Sale are their houses and free from herm, and
God holdeth not his rod oi wrath above them.

Who would believe it so, that but yesterday were
